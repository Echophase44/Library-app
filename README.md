# Library-app

- Add and remove books to your own virtual library.

## Goals

- This project is a focus on implementing OOP in JS with creating and removing objects in the DOM.

## Notes

- This was a great challenge and figuring out the "Delete" functionality was the most rewarding part.
- Biggest issue was having values being passed as strings when I was expecting numbers. Breaking down my code piece by piece to narrow down the issue was great troubleshooting experience.
